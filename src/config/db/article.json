     {"p": "Messenger launched in 2011 as a simple chat app carved out of Facebook’s main application. By 2013 it carried voice calls. In 2015 it added video. By 2018 a user could exchange money, order an Uber, play casual games, host group calls, and even speak to chatbots—all without leaving Messenger."},
     {"p": "That feature boom paid off in daily-active-user numbers, but every new capability came with additional code, more build targets, extra background services, and inevitably more edge-case bugs. Facebook’s leadership culture is famous for the mantra “move fast”; the shadow side of moving fast is that codebases can ossify faster than anyone expects."},
     {"p": "On iOS the Messenger binary ballooned to ~130 MB—uncomfortably close to Apple’s 200 MB cellular-download ceiling. Engineering dashboards showed alarming trends:"},

     ] },
     {"p": "Individually these metrics weren’t fatal. Together they pointed to an existential problem: Messenger had become a technical-debt minefield. Teams spent more time navigating legacy abstractions than shipping features—classic “innovation tax.”"},
     {"title": "The Moment of Truth: When Metrics Cross the Red Line"},
     {"p": " Facebook’s culture is data-obsessed; every significant feature has a dashboard. That habit paid off when Messenger’s leads searched for a single lurking function to justify drastic action. Two numbers made the case:"},

       {"li": "Launch latency &gt; 2 s: internal user-experience studies show drop-offs above 1.5 s."},

     ] },
     {"p": "Plenty of apps survive with two-second launches, but Messenger’s audience is global, many on mid-tier devices. A two-second average on iPhone meant three or four seconds on a $100 Android phone in Brazil or India—unacceptable for a chat tool."},
     {"p": " Something radical had to happen. The leadership green-lit a full-scale internal audit—the largest code review in Messenger’s history."},
