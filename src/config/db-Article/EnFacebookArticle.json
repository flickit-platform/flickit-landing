      {"pBold": "1. Use the OS"},
      {"p": "If iOS already ships a high-performance JSON parser, don’t reinvent one. If modern UIKit components solve a problem, dump the custom fork. By leaning on Apple’s battle-tested frameworks, Messenger could remove tons of bespoke layers—shrinking both code and memory use."},
      {"pBold": "2. Reuse the UI"},
      {"p": "Earlier versions had forty distinct view controllers, many nearly identical. LightSpeed collapses them into template-driven screens. A single view controller renders lists, grids, and detail views by ingesting a structural template from SQLite. Changing layout now means tweaking data, not shipping new code"},
      {"pBold": "3. Leverage SQLite"},
      {"p": "Traditional Messenger used in-memory caches glued together with home-grown transaction systems. Those layers added latency and edge cases. LightSpeed puts all authoritative state in SQLite; the UI observes tables. Concurrency, caching, and transactions come “for free” from SQLite’s engine."},
      {"pBold": "4. Move Everything Else to the Server"},
      {"p": "Historically, each client feature spoke directly to its server counterpart via a bespoke protocol. LightSpeed introduced a server broker—a gateway between Messenger and backend services. By consolidating network code paths, the team reduced redundancy and made it easier to deprecate legacy endpoints."},
