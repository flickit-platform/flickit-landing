These criteria are designed to measure the software product's maturity level across various quality attributes and dimensions, such as functionality, reliability, performance, and maintainability. After the data has been scored, the Flickit platform generates a maturity level report that shows the software product's maturity level across each quality attribute and dimension. The report typically includes a visual representation of the maturity level, such as a chart or graph, along with a detailed description of the evaluation results. By using this maturity level report, users can identify areas of strengths and weaknesses in their software products and prioritize improvement efforts accordingly. This report can also be used as a benchmarking tool to compare the software product's maturity level against industry standards or best practices. Overall, the Flickit platform's maturity level reports provide valuable insights into the quality and performance of software products, thus empowering users to make data-driven decisions and take targeted actions to improve their software maturity levels.",
